The McPherson Committee formed by Government of British India, recommended the establishment of an institution for imparting education in the fields of mining and geology, whose report, submitted in 1920, formed the main basis for establishment of the Indian School of Mines at Dhanbad, on 9 December 1926.[6]
The institute offered courses in Mining Engineering, Applied Geology, Applied Physics, Applied Chemistry and Applied Mathematics when it opened. In 1957, the institute began offering Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics. Up to 1967 it was a pure government institute where the faculties were recruited through Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).
